## What is this all about?

This is a site for my personal notes on computer science, competitive programming,
and other tech related things. I have divided this site into many sections. Also there is a
search feature, if you are looking for something just search the term. If you like these notes
bookmark it and share it with your friends, and if you find something wrong open a pull
request or an [issue](https://github.com/shivanshu-semwal/notes).

## Why should you also make something like this?

You have to make your own condensed notes. You learn from MAKING them. A lot
of thinking goes into deciding what to include and exclude. You develop your
own system of abbreviations and memory methods for the information.
Also you will be contributing to [open knowledge](https://okfn.org/) in this way.
