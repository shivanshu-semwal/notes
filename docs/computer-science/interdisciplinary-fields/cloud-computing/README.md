# Cloud Computing

> Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, over the internet ("the cloud"). Instead of hosting and managing applications or data on a local server or personal computer, users can access computing resources on-demand from a remote data center, which is managed and maintained by a third-party provider.

Cloud computing provides a scalable, flexible, and cost-effective way to access computing resources, allowing businesses and individuals to access the same powerful computing capabilities previously available only to large organizations with expensive IT infrastructures.

## Outline

- Cloud Architecture
    - Understanding the components and architecture of cloud computing systems, such as virtualization, containerization, and microservices.
- Cloud Infrastructure
    - Understanding the infrastructure of cloud computing, including servers, storage, networking, and security.
- Cloud Services
    - Familiarizing yourself with the different types of cloud services, such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
- Cloud Computing Platforms
    - Becoming proficient in one or more cloud computing platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), or Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
- Cloud Security
    - Understanding the security concerns and best practices related to cloud computing, such as data privacy, access control, and compliance.
- Cloud Deployment
    - Understanding the process of deploying applications and services to the cloud, including containerization and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) tools.
- Cloud Management
    - Learning how to manage cloud computing resources, including monitoring, scaling, and optimizing performance.
- Emerging Technologies
    - Keeping up-to-date with emerging technologies such as serverless computing, edge computing, and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) in the context of cloud computing.
