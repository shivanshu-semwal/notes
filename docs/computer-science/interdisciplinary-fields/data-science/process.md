# Data Science Process

## First we need to pre-process it into a usable form

- For **traditional data**
    - class labelling is done (categorical vs numerical)
    - data cleaning is done
    - missing valued are dealt with
    - case specific steps are also done, like balancing and
    shuffling datasets (like changing the schema of database, etc)
    - e.g. - basic customer data, historical stock price data
    - **Tools:**
        - **Programming:** R, Python, SQL, Matlab
        - **Software:** Excel, IBM SPSS
    - **Who does this:**
        - DATA ARCHITECT
        - DATA ENGINEER
        - DATABASE ADMINISTRATOR
- For **big data**
    - preprocessing is done same as with traditional data
    - case specific steps are also done, like text data mining
    - e.g. - social media, financial trade data
    - **Tools:**
        - **Programming:** R, Python, Java, Scala
        - **Software:** hadoop, HBASE, mongoDB
    - **Who does this:**
        - BIG DATA ARCHITECT
        - BIG DATA ENGINEER

## Now the data is processed in usable form, we use data to create reports and dashboards to gain business insights

- **What is done?**
    - data is analyzed, and info is extracted from it in form of:
        - KPI
        - metrics
        - reports
        - dashboards
- e.g. - price optimization, inventory management
- **Tools:**
    - **Programming:** R, Python, SQL, Matlab
    - **Tools:** Excel, PowerBI, SAS, Qlik, tableau
- **Who does this:**
    - BI ANALYST
    - BI CONSULTANT
    - BI DEVELOPER

## Now we do **Predictive Analysis** on the data. We can either use traditional techniques or machine learning

- Using **traditional techniques** advance statistical methods
    - **What is used:**
        - Regression
        - Logistic Regression
        - Clustering
        - Factor Analysis
        - Time Series
    - e.g - User Experience, Sales Forecasting
    - **Tools:**
        - **Programming:** R, Python, Matlab
        - **Software:** Excel, IBM SPSS, EViews, STATA
    - **Who does this**
        - DATA SCIENTIST
        - DATA ANALYST
- Using **Machine Learning**
    - **What is used:**
        - Supervised Learning
            - SVM
            - NN
            - deep learning
            - random forests
            - bayesian networks
        - Unsupervised Learning
            - K-means
            - deep learning
        - Reinforcement learning
    - e.g. fraud detection, client retention
    - **Tools:**
        - **Programming:** R, Python, Matlab, java, js, c, scala, c++
        - **Software:** Microsoft Azure, rapidminer
    - **Who does this:**
        - DATA SCIENTIST
        - MACHINE LEARNING ENGINEER
