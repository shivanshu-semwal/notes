# Libraries

- `pandas`
    - first you want to load the data, for that you require pandas
    - it converts the csv file you have into data frames
- `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
    - these are for visualizing the data you have
- `numpy`
    - when you want to convert your data into more compact usable for
    - like numpy array which is faster than the normal list of python
- `scipy`
    - when you want to perform some scientific calculations on the data
    - like calculating the ode, fft, integration and differentiation
- `scikit-learn`
    - this library contains list of algorithms used in machine learning
    - like classification, regression, etc
- `tensorflow`
    - if you want to make some neural networks, then you will need tensorflow
- `keras`
    - its api to interact with tensorflow, you need to use keras, which is module inside
    tensorflow.

Theses are basically all the libraries you will need for machine learning.

- **PyTorch** is an open source machine learning framework based on the Torch library,
    - used for applications such as
        - computer vision and
        - natural language processing,
        - primarily developed by Meta AI.
        - `pip install pytorch`
- **TensorFlow** is a free and open-source software library
    - for machine learning
    - and artificial intelligence.
    - It can be used across a range of tasks but has a
        - particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks
    - `pip install tensorflow`
- **OpenCV** is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision.
    - `pip install opencv-python`
- **NumPy** is a library for the Python programming language,
    - adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices,
    - along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
    - `pip install numpy`
- **SciPy** is a free and open-source Python library used for scientific computing and technical computing.
    - SciPy contains modules for
        - optimization,
        - linear algebra,
        - integration,
        - interpolation,
        - special functions,
        - FFT,
        - signal and
        - image processing,
        - ODE solvers and
        - other tasks common in science and engineering.
    - `pip install scipy`
- **Keras** is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface
    - for artificial neural networks.
    - Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library.
    - Up until version 2.3, Keras supported multiple backends, including
        - TensorFlow,
        - Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit,
        - Theano, and
        - PlaidML
- **Scikit-learn** is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language.
    - It features various
        - classification,
        - regression and
        - clustering algorithms including
            - support-vector machines,
            - random forests,
            - gradient boosting,
            - k-means and
            - DBSCAN,
    - and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries
        - NumPy and SciPy.
- **Matplotlib** is a plotting library for the Python programming language
    - and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
    - It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications
        - using general-purpose GUI toolkits like
            - Tkinter,
            - wxPython,
            - Qt, or
            - GTK.
- **pandas** is a software library written for the Python programming language
    - for data manipulation and analysis.
    - In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating
        - numerical tables and time series.
