# High level and low level design

## High level design

- optimize processes and increase throughput by using same resources
    - **vertical scaling**
- preparing beforehand daily at non peak hours
    - **preprocessing adn cron jobs**
- make system **resilient** - recovering form failures quickly
- keep **backups** and avoid single point of failure
- hire more resources
    - **horizontal scaling**
- microservice architecture
    - each service performs specific task - **decoupling**
- **distributed systems**
    - partitioning
- **load balancer**
- system should be
    - scalable
    - fault tolerance
    - extensible - easily modifiable to add new functionality
- **decoupling** - separation of responsibility, dividing into small systems
- **logging** and **metrics**

## Low level design

- classes
- uml
- functions
- signatures
