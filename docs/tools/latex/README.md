# LaTeX

LaTeX is a software system for document preparation.
A TeX distribution such as **Tex Live** or **MiKTeX** is used
to produce output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or
digital distribution.

LaTeX is intended to provide a high-level, descriptive markup language that accesses the power of TeX in an easier way for writers. In essence, TeX handles the layout side, while LaTeX handles the content side for document processing. LaTeX comprises a collection of TeX macros and a program to process LaTeX documents, and because the plain TeX formatting commands are elementary, it provides authors with ready-made commands for formatting and layout requirements such as chapter headings, footnotes, cross-references and bibliographies.
