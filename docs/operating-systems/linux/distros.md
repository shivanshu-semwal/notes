# Distros

So what are linux distros (distributions)?

- when linux started, other people started making their own customizations
  and putting their software on top (software of their preference)
- every distro is different usually in the way it install software
- there are some distro which are rolling release, i.e. you install it once
  and then keep updating it, you will never have to upgrade to a new
  distribution (like windows 10 to windows 11 as a analogy).
- then there are distributions which release major version then some minor
  and you will have to upgrade to them, you will most like use a
  LTS (long term support) version of such distro.
