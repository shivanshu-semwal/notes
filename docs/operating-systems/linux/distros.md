# Distros

So what are linux distros (distributions)?

Distros are like flavors made to serve different purposes.

You can ask yourself these questions and then can settle on some distro:

- Do you want the latest software versions? - take a rolling release distro
- Do you want the one which does not break frequently? - take one with a LTS (long term support) version
- Don't like properitary software?
- Want enterprise support and community support?
- Want a minimal operating system?
- Want a lightweight operating system?
- Do you want to compile every software from source?
