# Shell Build In Commands

Shell built-in commands are commands that are built into the shell itself, and they are executed directly by the shell without invoking external programs.

- `cd` - Used for changing the current working directory.
- `echo` - Displays text or variables to the terminal.
- `export` - Sets environment variables.
- `unset` - Removes environment variables.
- `alias` - Defines and displays aliases for commands.
- `history` - Shows command history.
- `type` - Displays information about a command (e.g., whether it's an alias, built-in, or external command).
- `exit` - Exits the current shell session.
- `logout` - Logs out of the current shell session (for login shells).
- `source` -(or dot): Executes commands from a script or file in the current shell environment.
- `builtin` - Displays a list of shell built-in commands.
- `jobs` - Lists background jobs.
- `fg` - Brings a background job to the foreground.
- `bg` - Resumes a background job.
- `ulimit` - Sets or displays user-level resource limits.
- `exec` - Replaces the current shell with a specified command, often used to execute a command without creating a new process.
- `wait` - Waits for background processes to finish.
