# fp vs oop

## fp

- use of functions where each function performs a specific task
- Fundamental elements used are variables and functions.
- The data in the functions are immutable.
- Importance is not given to data but to functions.
- It follows declarative programming model.
- It uses recursion for iteration.
- It is parallel programming supported.
- The statements does not need to follow a particular order while execution
- Does not have any access specifier.
- To add new data and functions is not so easy.
- No data hiding is possible. Hence, Security is not possible.

## oop

- Classes are used where instance of objects are created
- Fundamental elements used are objects and methods,
- The data used here are mutable data.
- Importance is given to data rather than procedures.
- It follows imperative programming model.
- It uses loops for iteration.
- It does not support parallel programming.
- The statements need to follow a order (bottom up approach while execution)
- Has three access specifiers namely, Public, Private and Protected.
- Provides and easy way to add new data and functions.
- Provides data hiding. Hence, secured programs are possible.
