## Regular Expressions

A regular expression is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. Usually such patterns are used by string-searching algorithms for "find" or "find and replace" operations on strings, or for input validation.

## Decorators

decorator is a design pattern in Python that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate.

## Lambdas

Python Lambda Functions are anonymous function means that the function is without a name. As we already know that the def keyword is used to define a normal function in Python. Similarly, the lambda keyword is used to define an anonymous function in Python.

## Iterators

An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values. An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values. Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__() .

## List Comprehensions

List comprehensions are a concise way to create a list using a single line of code in Python. They are a powerful tool for creating and manipulating lists, and they can be used to simplify and shorten code.

- [Python List Comprehensions](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)

## Generator Compressions

Generator comprehensions are a concise way to create a generator using a single line of code in Python. They are similar to list comprehensions, but instead of creating a list, they create a generator object that produces the values on-demand, as they are needed.

Generator comprehensions are a useful tool for creating generators that generate a large sequence of values, as they allow you to create the generator without creating the entire sequence in memory at once. This can be more efficient and use less memory, especially for large sequences.

## Python Paradigms

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language, which means that it supports several programming paradigms. Some of the main paradigms supported by Python are:

- Imperative programming: This paradigm focuses on telling the computer what to do, step by step. Python supports imperative programming with features such as variables, loops, and control structures.
- Object-oriented programming (OOP): This paradigm is based on the idea of objects and their interactions. Python supports OOP with features such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- Functional programming: This paradigm is based on the idea of functions as first-class citizens, and it emphasizes the use of pure functions and immutable data. Python supports functional programming with features such as higher-order functions, lambda expressions, and generators.
- Aspect-oriented programming: This paradigm is based on the idea of separating cross-cutting concerns from the main functionality of a program. Python does not have built-in support for aspect-oriented programming, but it can be achieved using libraries or language extensions.

Python's support for multiple paradigms makes it a versatile and flexible language, and it allows developers to choose the paradigm that best fits their needs.

## OOP

In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

### Methods and Dunder

A method in python is somewhat similar to a function, except it is associated with object/classes. Methods in python are very similar to functions except for two major differences.

- The method is implicitly used for an object for which it is called.
- The method is accessible to data that is contained within the class.

Dunder or magic methods in Python are the methods having two prefix and suffix underscores in the method name. Dunder here means “Double Under (Underscores)”. These are commonly used for operator overloading. Few examples for magic methods are: __init__, __add__, __len__, __repr__ etc.

### Inheritance

Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class.

- [Inheritance in Python](https://www.javatpoint.com/inheritance-in-python)

### Classes

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together. Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state. Class instances can also have methods (defined by their class) for modifying their state.

## Modules

Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions. A file containing Python code, for example: `example.py`, is called a module, and its module name would be example. We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.

- [Modules in Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/modules)

### Builtin Modules

Python interpreter has a number of built-in functions. They are always available for use in every interpreter session. Many of them have been discussed in previously. For example `print()` and `input()` for I/O, number conversion functions (`int()`, `float()`, `complex()`), data type conversions (`list()`, `tuple()`, `set()`) etc.

### Custom Modules

Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions. A file containing Python code, for example: `example.py`, is called a module, and its module name would be example. We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.
