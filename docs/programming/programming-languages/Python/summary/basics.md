# Python Basics

## Basic Syntax

Setup the environment for python and get started with the basics.

### Variables

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program. They also provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name, so our programs can be understood more clearly by the reader and ourselves. It is helpful to think of variables as containers that hold information. Their sole purpose is to label and store data in memory. This data can then be used throughout your program.

### Literals

- r prefixed string are raw, it treats `\` as raw character

```py
s = r'c:\path'
```

## Conditionals

Conditional Statements in Python perform different actions depending on whether a specific condition evaluates to true or false. Conditional Statements are handled by IF-ELIF-ELSE statements and MATCH-CASE statements in Python.

### Typecasting

The process of converting the value of one data type (integer, string, float, etc.) to another data type is called type conversion. Python has two types of type conversion: Implicit and Explicit.

## Functions

In programming, a function is a reusable block of code that executes a certain functionality when it is called. Functions are integral parts of every programming language because they help make your code more modular and reusable.

In Python, you define a function with the `def` keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon.

## Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

**Lists:** are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it the most powerful tool in Python.

**Tuple:** A Tuple is a collection of Python objects separated by commas. In some ways, a tuple is similar to a list in terms of indexing, nested objects, and repetition but a tuple is immutable, unlike lists that are mutable.

**Set:** A Set is an unordered collection data type that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. Python’s set class represents the mathematical notion of a set.

**Dictionary:** In python, Dictionary is an ordered (since Py 3.7) [unordered (Py 3.6 & prior)] collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, which, unlike other Data Types that hold only a single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair. Key-value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized.

## String Methods

Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square bracket can be used to access elements of the string.
There are methods which can be used on a string to best utilize it's wide range of functionalities.
Below Given resources can be utilised to learn more about them.

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected.
