# Testing

A key to building software that meets requirements without defects is testing. Software testing helps developers know they are building the right software. When tests are run as part of the development process (often with continuous integration tools), they build confidence and prevent regressions in the code.

## PyUnit / Unittest

PyUnit is an easy way to create unit testing programs and UnitTests with Python. (Note that docs.python.org uses the name "unittest", which is also the module name.)

## pytest

pytest is a mature full-featured Python testing tool that helps you write better programs.

## Doctest

Python's standard library comes equipped with a test framework module called doctest. The doctest module programmatically searches Python code for pieces of text within comments that look like interactive Python sessions. Then, the module executes those sessions to confirm that the code referenced by a doctest runs as expected.

## Nose

Nose is another opensource testing framework that extends `unittest` to provide a more flexible testing framework.
