# Python

Python is a versatile programming language used in various domains.

- Web Development
    - Used for backend development and statics sites
    - Frameworks: `Django`, `Flask`
    - Many statics site generators are also there like `mkdocs`
- Data Science and Machine Learning
    - due to huge number of existing libraries and simplicity of python
    - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`
- Automation and Scripting, used extensively for gui testing also
    - Tools: `Selenium`, `PyAutoGUI`
- Software Development
    - Tools: `PyQt`, `Tkinter`
- Game Development, not used that much in professional game development
    - Libraries: `Pygame`, `Panda3D`
- Networking and Security
   - Libraries: `Scapy`, `Paramiko`
   - Example: Writing tools for network monitoring, penetration testing, and automating security tasks. Python can be used to automate SSH connections, analyze network packets, or create custom security tools.
- Embedded Systems
   - Tools: `MicroPython`, `CircuitPython`
   - Example: Programming microcontrollers and small hardware devices. Python is used to control hardware like LEDs, sensors, and motors in IoT devices.
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning
   - Libraries: `Keras`, `PyTorch`, `OpenAI Gym`
-  DevOps and Cloud Computing
   - Tools: `Ansible`, `Boto3`
