Logging is an important feature that helps developers to trace out the errors. It provides the ability to capture the log file. Logging provides the complete tracing information of the application and also records the critical failure if any occur in an application. There are three components of Logging: Logger, Logging handlers or Appenders and Layouts or logging formatters.

## Log4j2

Apache Log4j is a Java-based logging utility. Log4j Java library's role is to log information that helps applications run smoothly, determine what's happening, and help with the debugging process when errors occur. Logging libraries typically write down messages to the log file or a database.

Log4j2 is the updated version of the popular and influential log4j library, used extensively throughout the Java ecosystem for so many years. Version 2. x keeps all the logging features of its predecessor and builds on that foundation with some significant improvements, especially in the area of performance.

## Logback

Logback is one of the most widely used logging frameworks in the Java Community. It's a replacement for its predecessor, Log4j. Logback offers a faster implementation, provides more options for configuration, and more flexibility in archiving old log files.

## Slf4j

The SLF4J or the Simple Logging Facade for Java is an abstraction layer for various Java logging frameworks, like Log4j 2 or Logback. This allows for plugging different logging frameworks at deployment time without the need for code changes.
