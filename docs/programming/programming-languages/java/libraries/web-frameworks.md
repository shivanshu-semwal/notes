# Web frameworks

- Spring
- Spring Boot
- Play Framework
- Spark

Frameworks are tools with pre-written code, that act as a template or skeleton, which can be reused to create an application by simply filling with your code as needed which enables developers to program their application with no overhead of creating each line of code again and again from scratch.

## Spring

Spring is a powerful open-source Java platform (framework), that is used to create and maintain web applications.

## Spring Boot

Spring Boot is an open source, microservice-based Java web framework. The Spring Boot framework creates a fully production-ready environment that is completely configurable using its prebuilt code within its codebase. The microservice architecture provides developers with a fully enclosed application, including embedded application servers.

## Play Framework

Play Framework is a high-productivity web application framework that allows the model-view-controller pattern. It is written in Scala but can also be used for other programming languages that are compiled and run on the JVM. e.g.Java.
