## Implementations

### SBCL

[SBCL](http://sbcl.org/) (*Steel Bank Common Lisp*) is a high-performance native code compiler written in Common Lisp and C. The code is descended from CMUCL. It features native threading support, a type inference engine (Useful with gradual typing) and an optimizing compiler.

Steel Bank Common Lisp is named, in honour of CMUCL, after Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon, who made their fortunes in steel and banking, respectively.

### CCL

[CCL](http://ccl.clozure.com/) (*Clozure Common Lisp*) is a native code Common Lisp implementation. It supports many platforms, all of which are at relative feature parity.

### ECL

[ECL](http://ecls.sourceforge.net/) (*Embeddable Common Lisp*) is an implementation that compiles Common Lisp to C, and is useful for bringing Common Lisp to new platforms and to embedded environments.

### CLISP

[GNU CLISP](http://www.clisp.org/) is an implementation that uses a bytecode compiler rather than a native code compiler. By not compiling to machine code, CLISP is easily portable and runs across a wide array of systems.

### ABCL

[ABCL](http://abcl.org/) (*Armed Bear Common Lisp*) is an implementation that targets the JVM.
