# Image Files

## Vector vs Raster

- vector - pdf, eps, svg, ai
- raster - jpg(jpeg), gif, tiff, raw, psd
- vector - works on mathematical points system
    - can be scaled indefinitely
    - ideal for logos, type work, and icons
    - don't use pixels and use math points
- **raster** - works on a pixel grid, a fixed size
    - each pixel is assigned a color
    - ideal for photos, web graphics, illustrations, with complex
    color and shadows.

## Lossy and Lossless compression

- lossy - removes unnecessarily data to reduce size
    - smaller size images
    - jpg, mpeg, mp3, h.264
- lossless - maintain all your data
    - gif, tiff, png
