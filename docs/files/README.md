# Files

In computing, a computer file is a resource for recording data on a computer storage device, primarily identified by its filename. Just as words can be written on paper, so can data be written to a computer file. Files can be shared with and transferred between computers and mobile devices via removable media, networks, or the Internet.

Here are some common types of files:

- Text
- Images
- Audio
- Video
- Fonts
- Documents (which includes combination of these types)
- Binary Application Files
    - Viruses
- Archives, they store collection of other file types

Files are compressed to reduce their size, this also changes their contents if we look them
from a normal text editor.
